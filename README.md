# My Wallet - Smart Expense Tracker App 💸

## Project Description 📝

Welcome to **My Wallet**, a modern full-stack expense tracking application built with **React Native**, **Expo**, **Clerk Authentication**, and a powerful backend using **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**.

This project is inspired by a real-world problem I personally encountered while managing the budget for a Satyanarayan Puja in my chawl. I realized how hard it is to track shared expenses when multiple people contribute, spend, and manage temporary balances. From this experience, I came up with the idea to build a collaborative expense tracker app that goes far beyond basic personal finance tools.


🧠 **Coded with industry best practices** using React Native — followed **modular folder structures**, **well-organized reusable components**, and **clean, scalable architecture** for long-term maintainability and collaboration.

## Problem Solving Origin 💡

During a **Satyanarayan Puja** in my chawl, I was made the treasurer. I had to collect money from every household and track every rupee spent—from flowers to sweets, gifts, and more. Initially, I used an Excel sheet to manage it:

* Collected money manually (cash/UPI)
* Logged all entries in Excel
* Deducted every expense manually and noted who spent it
* Managed reimbursements when seniors temporarily paid from their own pocket

It became chaotic when multiple people started spending and updating wasn't real-time. That day, I realized:

> "Why not build an app to manage such shared finances easily, and collaboratively?"

And so, **My Wallet** was born.
